## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Zustand** - State management
- **Hono** - Lightweight, performant server framework
- **oRPC** - End-to-end type-safe APIs with OpenAPI integration
- **Node.js** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Biome** - Linting and formatting
- **Husky** - Git hooks for code quality
- **PWA** - Progressive Web App support
- **Turborepo** - Optimized monorepo build system

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```
## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL running in Docker locally with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have Docker installed and running.
2. Start the DB container:
```bash
npm run db:start
```

3. Apply the schema to your database:
```bash
npm run db:push
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
